Welcome to our DandyHacks Project, UR Lil Buddy Bot.

UR Lil Buddy Bot has multiple functions which have all been implemented for the sole purpose of automating the menial and mundane tasks of every day life, so that its user could
fully focus on their work, while maintaining good physical and mental health.

These functions currently include:
- a discord bot that automatically sends you a list of the open dining halls on campus at common meal times
	- the bot will prompt you to choose one of these open dining halls
	- and the bot will then output the menu of that specific dining halls
- a discord bot that will output a list of nearby study areas
	- this is to allow for a mental and environmental refresh whenever the user feels particularly tired from focused work
	- the bot also takes into account the weather of the user's location, and will output a specific recommendation based on that information
- a program that, with permission of the user, accesses the webcam and constantly estimates the distance between the user's eyes and their screen
	- if the distance gets too close for an extended period of time, the program will read that as a sign of bad posture
	- and it will output a message telling you to fix your posture
- a program that will gradually place a blue light filter on the user's screen at 9 pm
	- this is to decrease eye strain
	- as well as encourage production of melatonin and healthy times
- a program that tracks the time spent on different windows applications as well as on Google Chrome tabs
	- at the end of the day, the discord bot will also output a report of how much time you spent on each tab
	- the program also will warn you when you're on unproductive websites, such as YouTube, Twitch, or Discord
